# :cat: Kottans Front-End Course
Repository created for [kottans frontend course](https://github.com/kottans/frontend). Will be filled with tasks for this course and my own impression about them.

### Task 0 - Git and GitHub :heavy_check_mark:
(https://github.com/kottans/frontend/blob/master/tasks/git-intro.md)

Basically I already knew some stuff related to __Git & GitHub__ since these are a part of my work and daily routine. But some of the commands and things were really new for me.
  * `git cherry-pick`
  * `git rebase`
  * `git tag`
  * some theoretical stuff & info

P.S. I'd like to admit the fact, that __Udacity__ lessons were kinda boring and more based on theory. Even though it is also important, it wasn't that interesting to study unlike __Learn Git Branching__ f.e.
