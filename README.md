### Task 0 - Git and GitHub :heavy_check_mark:
(https://github.com/kottans/frontend/blob/master/tasks/git-intro.md)

Basically I already knew some stuff related to Git & GitHub since these are a part of my work and daily routine. But some of the commands and things were really new for me.
  * `git cherry-pick`
  * `git rebase`
  * `git tag`
  * some theoretical stuff & info

Udacity completion
