# :cat: Kottans Front-End Course
Repository created for [kottans frontend course](https://github.com/kottans/frontend). Will be filled with tasks for this course and my own impression about them.

### Task 0 - Git and GitHub :heavy_check_mark:
(https://github.com/kottans/frontend/blob/master/tasks/git-intro.md)

Basically I already knew some stuff related to __Git & GitHub__ since these are a part of my work and daily routine. But some of the commands and things were really new for me.
  * `git cherry-pick`
  * `git rebase`
  * `git tag`
  * some theoretical stuff & info

P.S. I'd like to admit the fact, that __Udacity__ lessons were kinda boring and more based on theory. Even though it is also important, it wasn't that interesting to study unlike __Learn Git Branching__ f.e.

### Task 1 - Linux CLI, and HTTP :heavy_check_mark:
(https://github.com/kottans/frontend/blob/master/tasks/linux-cli-http.md)

This task helped me to improve my knowledge of __CLI__ commands and I'd say introduced to me the HTTP Protocol from a different side. __Codeacademy__ course *Learn The Command Line* was really interesting and way more interactive than __Udacity__ from *Task 0*. Thing I learned as new:
  * `pwd` - prints the working directory
  * `touch` - creates a new file
  * `PS1` - the command prompt and it's editing was also new to me
  * redirections and commands together with them (`grep`, `sed`)

The __HTTP Protocol__ part helped me to understand the basics and request verbs. The most interesting part for me was __jQuery Ajax__
